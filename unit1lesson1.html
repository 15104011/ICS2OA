        <h3>Skills in a Computer Environment</h3>
        <p>
          <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/skill" target="_blank">Skills</a> are specific abilities that we learn.
          There is a book by author <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Gladwell" target="_blank">Malcolm Gladwell</a>,
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)" target="_blank"><em>"Outliers,"</em></a> that says that it takes about ten
          thousand hours of practice to truly master ones craft. The book was a compilation of lives of notable people who've reached success in
          their fields and how they've managed to do so. I personally, am still reading this novel as I think it's a great insight on how hard
          work, perseverence and determination can be when one truly dedicates themselves to whatever it is they want to become good at. If you've
          read my <a href="about.html" target="_blank">introduction</a>, I was completely lost at the beginning of this course and I honestly doubted
          myself and questioned why I even took it, but, It cost me 40 bucks so that pretty much kept me motivated to just <em>pass</em> the course
          and get by. However, after several months of trying to wrap my head around the concepts, I actually started to enjoy the course which lead
          me to further investigate about computer science. I like math, so when I found that there were many aspects of computer science with math,
          I was fascinated and things started to fall in to place. Here is a link to a blog about
          <a href="http://www.wisdomgroup.com/blog/10000-hours-of-practice/" target="_blank"><em>Outliers</em></a>.
           The point is, skills are learned and talent is overrated, here is an advice I found from a former
           Olympiad finalist in Informatics on <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-does-one-prepare-for-the-IOI-Aiming-for-gold/answer/Brian-Bi" target="_blank">Quora</a>.

           extended capacity) can hold up to 2 TB. They are small (32 x 24 x 2.1 mm) and wafer-thin. Many computers

           and reprogrammed in blocks, and then reused by exposing it to an electrical charge. It usually comes in a small
          (about 4cm) plastic case with a USB plug that can be inserted into a computer's USB port.
         Flash memory is sometimes called keychain memory, because it often comes attached to a key chain.</td>

  <h3>A Virtual Filing Cabinet</h3>
      <p>Within any storage device (whether it is a hard drive, an external drive, or a flash drive),
       an electronic folder to store files can be created that have a common theme.</p>
       <p>In most operating systems, these folders are even represented by an icon that looks like a little folder.
        These electronic folders are nested within one another--folders within folders within folders, all containing
       documents. This filing system is a framework within which to store work.</p>
