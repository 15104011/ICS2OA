# ICS2OA
An experimental webpage used to demonstrate what I have learned throughout the course ICS2OA. Used html and css to draft the page from scratch, purchased the domain from namecheap.com and using webhostingforstudents.com to host the website. Managing the files with FileZilla. This project is an ongoing experiment, atleast until the course deadline (May 31, 2016).
